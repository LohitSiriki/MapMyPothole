# Pothole Mapping

## Overview

This project aims to map potholes based on data collected from a GPS logger (in a .csv format). The python script processes the .csv data and generates a map highlighting pothole locations.

The main info we are going to need from the .csv is the latitude and longitude. This info can be received from either a gps logger or metadata of an image (here, a pothole image).
The map i've used to map the pothole is osm map.

Future work can be completely automating this by detecting a pothole real-time and mapping it to your current location.
